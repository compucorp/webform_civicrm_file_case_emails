# Webform CiviCRM File Case Emails

On each webform submission this module would create an activity linked to a case
and attach original notification email as `.eml` file to it. So user would be
able to download and open this file with some email application
(e.g: Thunderbird, Outlook) to view all details of the original email. This may
be useful in some legal cases for example.

This module affects all webforms that are configured:
1. For CiviCRM processing.
1. To create/update a Case.
1. To send an email (notification).
